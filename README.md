To work towards my career interests, I’d need support from both my manager and team members. For technical growth, I’d benefit from mentorship within the automation testing team—regular check-ins to track my progress and feedback on areas for improvement. Having access to learning resources, like courses or certifications in automation testing and data analysis, would also be helpful. To explore data analysis, I could collaborate with the data team on small projects to get hands-on experience.

For leadership and public speaking, I’d appreciate opportunities to lead smaller tasks or present in team meetings. My manager could help by assigning me these responsibilities gradually, while offering constructive feedback. Additionally, pairing with a more experienced colleague for guidance on leadership skills would be beneficial in developing my confidence as a future leader.

To support my career growth, I would need guidance from my team leader and support from my colleagues. Regular feedback on my work in automation testing would help me improve and ensure I’m progressing in the right direction. Access to resources like courses or workshops in data analysis could also help me explore my interests in that area.

I would appreciate opportunities to practice public speaking, such as presenting in team meetings or leading small discussions. To develop my leadership skills, shadowing a team lead or being given responsibility for small projects would help me transition from a team player to a leader.

My team lead would play a key role in providing mentorship, while I would take the initiative to seek learning opportunities and ask for more responsibilities as I grow. This support will help me thrive in my current role and prepare for future opportunities.
